    <h2>üßë‚Äçüíª About the Developer</h2>
    <p>This website was developed by <strong>Shivam Maurya</strong> --- student at ABES Engineering College with a passion for web design, campus culture, and creative storytelling.</p>
    <p><strong>Why I built this site:</strong></p>
    <p>I wanted to create a platform that showcases the energy and pride of our college‚Äîwhere students can explore events, register for fests, and relive campus moments. It‚Äôs more than just a site‚Äîit‚Äôs a celebration of ABES spirit.</p>
    <p>From debugging layouts to designing highlight cards, every section reflects my love for clean design, modern UI, and student collaboration.</p>
